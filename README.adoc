^|Project | Description

^.^|LZW_Core
|Core functionality of LZW coding. All logic is there including file i/o. This project produces [underline]#static library# that is used in _LZW_CLI_ and _LZW_Core_Tests_ as a dependency.

^.^|LZW_CLI
|Command-Line Interface for _LZW_Core_ functions. This project produces executable program called `lzw` (by default).

^.^|LZW_Core_Tests
|Collection of unit tests for _LZW_Core_ functionalities. This project produces executable with embeded CLI from Catch2. For more info read https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/docs/command-line.md[official docs].

=== External libraries

_LZW_Core_ library doesn't have any external dependencies except C++ standard library.

* https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11[CLI11] provides command-line arguments parser for _LZW_CLI_.
* https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2[Catch2] is used in _LZW_Core_Tests_ as a testing framework.

== Building

You need https://premake.github.io/download.html[Premake5] to easily generate project files (e.g. for Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, Xcode, GNU Make and more)

In root folder run `premake5` with an argument depending on IDE you want to use. For example, run: `premake5 vs2019` if you want to generate project for Visual Studio 2019.

== Tests

Project _LZW_Core_Tests_ contains all the tests for _LZW_Core_. You can build it and run executable `lzw_core_tests` to verify tests.
